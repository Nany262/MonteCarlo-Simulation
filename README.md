# MonteCarlo-Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is a simple, flexible and scalable algorithm that aims at the generation of objects or random processes by means of a computer in objects that may arise naturally. The main objective of this project is to use the MonteCarlo algorithm to simulate the energy levels consumed by electric vehicles for different percentages of penetration in the city of Pereira.
